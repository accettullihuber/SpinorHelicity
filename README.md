# SpinorHelicity
In this repository we make the Mathematica package SpinorHelicity6D publicly available. This is a provisional version
of two soon to be released packages: the first dealing with four-dimensional spinor helicity (both massless and massive)
and the second with six-dimensional spinor helicity. Features include analytic manipulations as well as numerical evaluations.
